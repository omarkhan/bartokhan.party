  <h2>Party people:</h2>
  <p>
    We’ve hit a few snags with our house rental - turns out there are more
    rules than we expected. What we thought was the backyard of the house is
    actually national park territory so the layout of the party will be a bit
    different: we won’t be able to have many chairs and tables outside so
    it’ll be more of a picnic-type arrangement for dinner; there’s always the
    option to eat inside at a table.
  </p>
  <p>
    Parking is very limited, so we kindly ask whoever can to carpool or take
    taxis/lyfts/ubers. There is public parking next door at the national park
    services building, as well as a half mile down the road at the Boston
    Store visitor center, but parking spaces are not guaranteed. If you need
    to park elsewhere give us a call and we can arrange for someone to come
    pick you up (please no later than 7!). For those that are parking
    overnight, we will provide a hangtag that you’ll need to display.
  </p>
  <p>
    Damn the man, save the party. It’s going to be excellent.

  <h2>Fix up look sharp</h2>
  <p>
    Allison says "dressy casual", which sounds like an oxymoron to me. No need
    to wear a tie, but dresses for the ladies and button-down shirts with
    slacks for dudes would be nice. If in doubt,
    <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=dressy+casual+wedding&tbm=isch">google it</a>.

  <h2>Lodging</h2>
  <p>The house sleeps 30 people, mostly in shared rooms like this:</p>
